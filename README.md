This project is a smart transportation management system designed for companies or institutions. It allows managers to organize trips, assign drivers, and manage vehicles, while drivers can view their assigned trips and passengers can register, book trips, and review their tickets. The system features both a graphical user interface (GUI) and a console interface, making it user-friendly and efficient for handling daily transportation operations. Data is securely managed using text files, and the application applies object-oriented programming principles for reliability and scalability
